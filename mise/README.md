# Mise

The [mise][1] folder contains the mise configuration and tasks.

Mise is:
- a polyglot tool version manager (think nvm, rbenv, ...)
- a way to set environment variables, similar to dotenv
- a task runner

This tool is only used for development and doesn't have any impact on production.

Feel free to use it or not.

You can place local configuration in `mise.local.toml`, which  should not be committed to source
control.
